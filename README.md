# Instance-Segmentation-with-Discriminative-Loss

This code is pytorch implementation of 'Semantic Instance Segmentation with a Discriminative Loss Function' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02551)

I slightly updated and revised the code of https://github.com/Wizaron/instance-segmentation-pytorch. The updated content is as follows.

  - revised the Dataset which does not use lmdb

  - added other networks (UNet, UNet with CBAM, DeepLabV3)
